  <!-- Span is inline so it gets your boxes in one single line, whereas div are blocks
which gets your boxes one below the other. you can use "display: inline" to make
your blocks in one single line and vice versa but then you cant change their width.
So for that very reason we use "display: inline-block". This allows me to set
my height and width to how much ever i want and i can also get it inline i.e
side by side.
control + Z for undo -->
